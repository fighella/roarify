        POOL - DAY<br>  The pool casts wavy distortions upon TWO DOZEN MEN, all\n  grumbling
        as they stand in line, wearing T-shirts with FBI\n  logos, sweats and sneakers.  We
        hear a splash, and the men\n  shuffle forward.<br>                           PAPPAS
        (V.O.)\n            The dolls love this baby.  It brings\n            them
        luck when they rub it -- right\n            between their buttons.<br>  CLOSE
        ON tape measure wrapped around a generous belly.\n  PULL BACK to reveal VETERAN
        AGENT COREY measuring the\n  ample waist of ANGELO PAPPAS.  This 54 year old
        silver\n  haired Greek stands rubbing his belly like a Zulu chief.<br>                           COREY\n            Angelo,
        we need a bigger tape.<br>                           PAPPAS\n            Just
        read the goddamn number.<br>                           COREY\n            Still
        a 46.  Maybe we can cinch it\n            down, wear a girdle--<br>                           PAPPAS\n            Screw
        you and this holistic fitness\n            crap!  At least my arms don''t
        flap\n            in the wind.<br>  Corey secretly squeezes his bicep as...\n  A
        whistle blows.  A broad shouldered MAN wearing an FBI\n  cap barks at the
        Greek.<br>                           BIG SHOULDERS\n            Okay, Pappas,
        let''s put on the\n            blindfold.  Wanna see you retrieve\n            at
        least two bricks from the bottom.<br>  JOHNNY UTAH enters the pool area in
        the distance.  Says\n  something to one of the agents.  Is pointed toward
        us as--\n  Corey ties the blindfold and guides Pappas to the edge of\n  the
        pool.<br>                           PAPPAS\n            I''ve been in the
        field 33 years,\n            fired my piece 23 times in the line\n            of
        duty, and I got no idea what a\n            blind man fetching bricks has
        gotta\n            do with being a Special Agent!<br>  Johnny has walked up.  Pappas,
        blindfolded, turns directly\n  to Utah as he continues, thinking it''s Corey.<br>                           PAPPAS\n            Added
        to which indignity, I got\n            three months left to retirement and\n            they
        saddle me with some blue-flamer\n            fresh out of Quantico for a partner.\n            Some
        quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas\n            or something.<br>                           UTAH\n            The
        shit they pull, huh?<br>  Pappas snorts agreement and cannonballs into the
        pool.\n  Huge backblast of water.  The other agents hoot and\n  holler.\n  Corey
        swears and wipes off his clipboard.\n  Johnny steps to the edge, looks down.\n  We
        see the blindfolded Pappas groveling along the bottom.\n  The other agents
        cheer as Pappas heads for the surface.<br>                           COREY\n            Here
        he comes.  Hold up a fish,\n            he''ll take it right outta your hand.<br>  Pappas
        surfaces in an explosion of spray as he sputters\n  for breath.  He grabs
        the edge and angrily slaps two\n  bricks on the tiles.  He rips off the blindfold
        looks up\n  and frowns.<br>  A HAND ENTERS FRAME to help him up.  Pappas takes
        it and\n  Johnny hauls him on deck.<br>                           COREY\n            Hey
        Shamu, this is your guy.<br>  Pappas eyes the new agent warily.  Extends his
        hand.<br>                           PAPPAS\n            Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.<br>                           UTAH\n            Punk.  Quarterback
        Punk.<br>                           PAPPAS\n                    (grinning)\n            Welcome
