        Razorhead definitely sees him.<br/>  JOHNNY reaches the beach and jogs up

        THE SHOWER Johnny sets down his gear and opens his\n  wetsuit to the warm,
        salt-free jet of water.  TRACKING\n  SLOWLY IN on him as he lets it pour over
        his face.\n  A HAND ENTERS FRAME, shutting off the water suddenly.<br/>  TIGHT
        ON UTAH, his eyes opening.<br/>  REVERSE, revealing RAZORHEAD and THREE OTHERS.\n  They
        are powerfully built SURF-NAZIS.\n  Scalps shaved on the sides.  Hair military
        short on top,\n  lengthening into pigtails in the back.  Tattoos.  Wrist\n  chains.\n  TONE,
        ARCHBOLD and WARCHILD.  The one who socked Utah\n  before is BUNKER.  They
        spread out flanking him.<br/>                           WARCHILD\n            This

        they lunge, Utah grabs his board and swings it in a\n  whistling roundhouse.  Its
        edge slams Warchild in the gut\n  and folds him double.  The bad news is...
        Warchild gets an\n  arm around it and brings a pile-driver hammer-punch down.\n  The
        board splits into two pieces.\n  Utah drops his end as the others close.  A
        flurry of\n  punches and kicks, most of which he blocks.  But he''s lost\n  the
        offensive.\n  Bunker takes him to his knees with a vicious karate-style\n  side-kick.<br/>  TIGHT
        ON Utah''s towel, talking with Pappas'' voice.<br/>                           PAPPAS\n            Johnny?  You
        there?<br/>  ANGELO gets out of the car fast.  He jogs twenty feet and\n  raises
        the binoculars.  Catches a glimpse of the carnage\n  around the edge of the
        building.  Breaks into a run,\n  massive legs pistoning.<br/>  JOHNNY HITS
        THE GROUND hard.  He rolls and comes up fast.\n  The razorhead brothers are
        a little surprised.<br/>                           ARCHBOLD\n            The
        dude can fight!<br/>  Warchild grabs Utah from behind.  Gets him in a headlock.\n  Archbold
        and Tone pin his arms.  Bunker starts working him\n  like a practice bag.  At
        this moment, Johnny is getting\n  the proverbial shit beat out of him.\n  SUDDENLY,
        a new figure blurs INTO FRAME.<br/>  BODHI seizes Bunker and flings him aside.  He
        spins with\n  remarkable agility and drives his heel into Warchild''s\n  face.\n  Utah
        breaks free, staggering back on the sand.  The fight\n  is still there in
        his eyes.<br/>  Bodhi is at his side -- holding the others at bay with a\n  raised
        hand and an evil look.<br/>                           BODHI\n            Back
        off!  Now!!  Just let it go!<br/>                           BUNKER\n            Stay

        with me.  Now back off.\n            Seriously.Just do it!\n                    (they
        relax slightly)\n            You alright Warchild?<br/>                           WARCHILD\n                    (holding

        has backed off a bit, panting.\n  Utah steps toward Bunker.  Like he''s maybe
        going to shake\n  hands.<br/>                           UTAH\n            What''s
        your name?<br/>                           BUNKER\n            Bunker.<br/>                           UTAH\n            Well,
        listen, Bunker... I''m actually\n            kinda glad you found me.<br/>                           BUNKER\n            Yeah?  Why?<br/>  Johnny
        answers with a LIGHTNING ROUNDHOUSE that hits with\n  a CRACK!  They can hear
        it in Pomona.\n  BUNKER HITS THE GROUND.  Flat out.  Lights out.\n  Tone,
        Archbold and Warchild lunge like dogs.\n  Bodhi yanks Utah out of the line
        of fire.<br/>                           BODHI\n            Whoa!  Whoa!  Hold
        it, ladies.  Give\n            it a rest.\n                    (to Utah)\n            Let''s
        go.<br/>  He literally turns Utah around.\n  They begin to walk, stepping
        over the pieces of Johnny''s\n  board.<br/>                           BODHI\n                    (under
        his breath)\n            Do me a favor, Johnny, just keep\n            walking.<br/>  Tone
        starts to go after them.  Archbold grabs his arm.\n  They help Bunker up.  Warchild
        holds he bleeding nose.\n  Utah and Bodhi start up the stairs, turn a corner
        and run\n  HEAD-ON into a huffing PAPPAS.\n  The big man clocks a battered
        but intact Utah.\n  We see him shift gears in his head in 2 tenths of a\n  second.<br/>                           PAPPAS\n                    (out
        of breath)\n            Uh, you guys seen a kid, maybe 10,\n            12,
        running with a car stereo?\n            Stole the fucking CD too, you\n            believe

        subtle, if it''s here at all.\u003cbr\u003e  PAPPAS WATCHES as Johnny crosses
        toward the outside shower\n  next to the public restroom.\n  LONG LENS view
        of Utah passing OUT OF SIGHT behind the\n  building.\u003cbr\u003e  AT THE
        SHOWER Johnny sets down his gear and opens his\n  wetsuit to the warm, salt-free
        jet of water.  TRACKING\n  SLOWLY IN on him as he lets it pour over his face.\n  A
        HAND ENTERS FRAME, shutting off the water suddenly.\u003cbr\u003e  TIGHT ON
        UTAH, his eyes opening.\u003cbr\u003e  REVERSE, revealing RAZORHEAD and THREE
        OTHERS.\n  They are powerfully built SURF-NAZIS.\n  Scalps shaved on the sides.  Hair
        military short on top,\n  lengthening into pigtails in the back.  Tattoos.  Wrist\n  chains.\n  TONE,
        ARCHBOLD and WARCHILD.  The one who socked Utah\n  before is BUNKER.  They
        spread out flanking him.\u003cbr\u003e                           WARCHILD\n            This
        the guy?\u003cbr\u003e                           BUNKER\n            Yeah.\u003cbr\u003e                           UTAH\n                    (good

        about how locals rule and yuppie\n            insects like me shouldn''t be
        surfing\n            your break and all that, right?\u003cbr\u003e                           BUNKER\n            No.\u003cbr\u003e                           TONE\n            Waste
        of time.\u003cbr\u003e                           WARCHILD\n            We''re
        just going to fuck you up.\u003cbr\u003e                           UTAH\n            Oh.\u003cbr\u003e  As
        they lunge, Utah grabs his board and swings it in a\n  whistling roundhouse.  Its
        edge slams Warchild in the gut\n  and folds him double.  The bad news is...
        Warchild gets an\n  arm around it and brings a pile-driver hammer-punch down.\n  The
        board splits into two pieces.\n  Utah drops his end as the others close.  A
        flurry of\n  punches and kicks, most of which he blocks.  But he''s lost\n  the
        offensive.\n  Bunker takes him to his knees with a vicious karate-style\n  side-kick.\u003cbr\u003e  TIGHT
        ON Utah''s towel, talking with Pappas'' voice.\u003cbr\u003e                           PAPPAS\n            Johnny?  You
        there?\u003cbr\u003e  ANGELO gets out of the car fast.  He jogs twenty feet
        and\n  raises the binoculars.  Catches a glimpse of the carnage\n  around
        the edge of the building.  Breaks into a run,\n  massive legs pistoning.\u003cbr\u003e  JOHNNY
        HITS THE GROUND hard.  He rolls and comes up fast.\n  The razorhead brothers
        are a little surprised.\u003cbr\u003e                           ARCHBOLD\n            The
        dude can fight!\u003cbr\u003e  Warchild grabs Utah from behind.  Gets him
        in a headlock.\n  Archbold and Tone pin his arms.  Bunker starts working him\n  like
        a practice bag.  At this moment, Johnny is getting\n  the proverbial shit
        beat out of him.\n  SUDDENLY, a new figure blurs INTO FRAME.\u003cbr\u003e  BODHI
        seizes Bunker and flings him aside.  He spins with\n  remarkable agility and
        drives his heel into Warchild''s\n  face.\n  Utah breaks free, staggering
        back on the sand.  The fight\n  is still there in his eyes.\u003cbr\u003e  Bodhi
        is at his side -- holding the others at bay with a\n  raised hand and an evil
        look.\u003cbr\u003e                           BODHI\n            Back off!  Now!!  Just
        let it go!\u003cbr\u003e                           BUNKER\n            Stay
        outta this, Bodhi!\u003cbr\u003e                           BODHI\n            He''s
        with me.  Now back off.\n            Seriously.Just do it!\n                    (they
        relax slightly)\n            You alright Warchild?\u003cbr\u003e                           WARCHILD\n                    (holding
        his bleeding\n                     nose)\n            Fuck you.\u003cbr\u003e  Everybody
        has backed off a bit, panting.\n  Utah steps toward Bunker.  Like he''s maybe
        going to shake\n  hands.\u003cbr\u003e                           UTAH\n            What''s
        your name?\u003cbr\u003e                           BUNKER\n            Bunker.\u003cbr\u003e                           UTAH\n            Well,
        listen, Bunker... I''m actually\n            kinda glad you found me.\u003cbr\u003e                           BUNKER\n            Yeah?  Why?\u003cbr\u003e  Johnny
        answers with a LIGHTNING ROUNDHOUSE that hits with\n  a CRACK!  They can hear
        it in Pomona.\n  BUNKER HITS THE GROUND.  Flat out.  Lights out.\n  Tone,
        Archbold and Warchild lunge like dogs.\n  Bodhi yanks Utah out of the line
        of fire.\u003cbr\u003e                           BODHI\n            Whoa!  Whoa!  Hold
        it, ladies.  Give\n            it a rest.\n                    (to Utah)\n            Let''s
        go.\u003cbr\u003e  He literally turns Utah around.\n  They begin to walk,
        stepping over the pieces of Johnny''s\n  board.\u003cbr\u003e                           BODHI\n                    (under
        his breath)\n            Do me a favor, Johnny, just keep\n            walking.\u003cbr\u003e  Tone
        starts to go after them.  Archbold grabs his arm.\n  They help Bunker up.  Warchild
        holds he bleeding nose.\n  Utah and Bodhi start up the stairs, turn a corner
        and run\n  HEAD-ON into a huffing PAPPAS.\n  The big man clocks a battered
        but intact Utah.\n  We see him shift gears in his head in 2 tenths of a\n  second.\u003cbr\u003e                           PAPPAS\n                    (out
