        at each\n  other as they cut aggressive moves close to each other.\n  Dolphins
        playing.\n  Challenging each other in mock combat.\n  So good, their boards
        slash past each other with inches to\n  spare.\n  There is an incredible sense
        of freedom and exhilaration.\n  Bonding forged through mastery of this arcane
        art.\n  For the first time we see the core group of Bodhi''s tribe,\n  by
        themselves.  It dawns on us...\n  There are four of them.\n  And at that moment
        Nathaniel drops in front of Bodhi,\n  laughing at the near miss, and drops
        his pants in a nasty\n  wig-wagging moon.<br/>  TRACKING SLOWLY IN ON JOHNNY
        staring, mouth open.\n  Watching the four horsemen of the Apocalypse ride
        toward\n  him.<br/>  IN SLOW MOTION, BODHI grins as he slashes past Nathaniel''s\n  shining
        white butt.<br/>  ON JOHNNY, as he reacts to the dawning certainty.\n  He
        feels weak, dizzy... like the ground is moving under\n  him.<br/>                           TYLER\n            Hey.  You
        okay?  You look like you\n            saw a ghost.<br/>  SHOCK CUT -- ANGELO
        TURNING TOWARD HIM, at the drop car\n  scene.  Eons ago.  The sound of his
        voice ringing...<br/>                           PAPPAS\n            Forget
        about it, kid, They''re\n            ghosts...<br/>  BACK TO JOHNNY, as he
        backs away from Tyler.  Still in\n  shock, recoiling from the situation.<br/>                           UTAH\n            I...

        wrong Johnny?\n                    (goes back to him)\n            You''re
        like a different person.\u003cbr\u003e  He stares at her.  His expression
        dark... wrestling with\n  something.\u003cbr\u003e                           UTAH\n            I
        am a different person, Tyler.\u003cbr\u003e  He lets out a long breath and
        looks away, out to sea.\u003cbr\u003e  JOHNNY''S POV... the water receding
        into a backlit wall of\n  mist.\n  FIGURES APPEAR, faint silhouettes in the
        fog.\n  Shades of gray in the gray.\n  IN SLOW MOTION they weave hypnotically
        across the screen,\n  their shapes merging and unmerging as they cross each\n  other.\u003cbr\u003e  STACKED
        UP BY THE EXTREME LONG LENS, Bodhi, Roach, Grommet\n  and Nathaniel crave
        and slash toward us with mystical\n  grace.\u003cbr\u003e  In SUSPENDED TIME
        we see them hooting and grinning at each\n  other as they cut aggressive moves
        close to each other.\n  Dolphins playing.\n  Challenging each other in mock
        combat.\n  So good, their boards slash past each other with inches to\n  spare.\n  There
        is an incredible sense of freedom and exhilaration.\n  Bonding forged through
        mastery of this arcane art.\n  For the first time we see the core group of
        Bodhi''s tribe,\n  by themselves.  It dawns on us...\n  There are four of
        them.\n  And at that moment Nathaniel drops in front of Bodhi,\n  laughing
        at the near miss, and drops his pants in a nasty\n  wig-wagging moon.\u003cbr\u003e  TRACKING
        SLOWLY IN ON JOHNNY staring, mouth open.\n  Watching the four horsemen of
        the Apocalypse ride toward\n  him.\u003cbr\u003e  IN SLOW MOTION, BODHI grins
        as he slashes past Nathaniel''s\n  shining white butt.\u003cbr\u003e  ON JOHNNY,
        as he reacts to the dawning certainty.\n  He feels weak, dizzy... like the
        ground is moving under\n  him.\u003cbr\u003e                           TYLER\n            Hey.  You
        okay?  You look like you\n            saw a ghost.\u003cbr\u003e  SHOCK CUT
        -- ANGELO TURNING TOWARD HIM, at the drop car\n  scene.  Eons ago.  The sound
        of his voice ringing...\u003cbr\u003e                           PAPPAS\n            Forget
        about it, kid, They''re\n            ghosts...\u003cbr\u003e  BACK TO JOHNNY,
        as he backs away from Tyler.  Still in\n  shock, recoiling from the situation.\u003cbr\u003e                           UTAH\n            I...
        I gotta go.\u003cbr\u003e                           TYLER\n            Johnny...
        what''s going on?  I don''t\n            get it... did I do something?\u003cbr\u003e                           UTAH\n            No.  I''m
        sorry.  I have to go.\n            I''ll, uh... I''ll call you later.\n            I''m
        sorry.\u003cbr\u003e  He sets off running up the beach.\n  Tyler stares after
        him.  Confused and hurt.\u003cbr\u003e                                              DISSOLVE
        TO:\u003cbr\u003e  EXT.  PAPPAS'' HOUSE - NIGHT\u003cbr\u003e  Early evening.  Utah
        pulls into the driveway.  When he\n  kills the engine we hear Greek music
        from inside the\n  house.\u003cbr\u003e  AT THE ENTRANCE Johnny finds the
        door ajar.  He pushes it\n  open a little to reveal--\u003c\/p\u003e","vendor":"Sutterer
