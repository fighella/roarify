        - DAY  Johnny weaves the sedan among the creeping commuters.\n  Long glittering
        lines and heat waves.                           UTAH\n            I say we
        call it in.  Get some\n            backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp\n            won''t
        listen to me.                           PAPPAS\n            Sure.  No problem.  I''ll
        just call\n            up and tell him his favorite agent\n            saw
        this one surfer moon another\n            surfer yesterday and it looked real\n            suspicious.  Shit,
        he''ll probably\n            call out the National Guard.                           UTAH\n            I
        say we don''t call it in.  Under no\n            circumstance are we to call
        this in.                           PAPPAS\n            Look, we handle it
        ourselves, for\n            right now, okay?  We cover the bank,\n            whatever.  You
        and me.  That way if\n            nothing happens, or more accurately,\n            when
        nothing happens... I don''t get\n            my tits any further into the
        wringer\n            than they already are.                                              CUT
        TO:  EXT.  ASSURED TRUST SAVING AND LOAN  SLOW PAN from the facade of the
        bank halfway up the block\n  to Utah''s sedan in the TIGHT F.G.  Head flopped
        back over\n  the seat, Angelo snoozes in the hot sun with a sports page\n  over
        his face.  Johnny looks at his watch for the fiftieth\n  time.  Whole lot
        of nothing going on.  Angelo slides the sports page down to his chin, without\n  otherwise
        moving.                           PAPPAS\n            Time for lunch.                           UTAH\n            Angelo,
        it''s eleven thirty.                           PAPPAS\n            That place
        up the street has\n            meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.  Utah slides
        out of the car.  Feeling a little exposed he\n  pulls his Dodgers cap down
        a little tighter, and adjusts\n  his sunglasses.\n  He trudges off through
        the sidewalk crowd toward the FAST-\n  FOOD STAND nearby.\n  Pappas pulls
        the sports page back up to block the sun.                                              CUT
        TO:  EXT.  FAST FOOD PLACE  ON A LONG LENS, very stacked up, we see Johnny
        standing at\n  the grody pick-up window.  He keeps looking at the bank,\n  visible
        B.G.\n  The pick-up window opens and food appears, sliding out.\n  Utah turns,
        pulling out his wallet.                           VOICE FROM INSIDE\n            Two
        meatball, one tuna on wheat,\n            two lemonades.  Total''s seven eighty\n            four.  As
        Johnny is counting out the bills, a BURGUNDY\n  THUNDERBIRD pulls up in front
        of the bank.  The doors fly\n  open.\n  The Ex-Presidents jump out.\n  They
        sprint for the entrance.  All this OUT OF FOCUS, B.G.\n  Johnny misses it
        as he picks up the food order.\n  The Presidents disappear inside.\n  Johnny
        looks toward the bank again.  There is no movement.  REVERSE, as Utah walks
        back toward his car.  Pappas is\n  still under the paper.  He slides it down
        when he smells\n  food.                           UTAH\n            Here,
        yours is the one that looks\n            like a road kill.  Enjoy.  Utah throws
        a big stack of napkins through the window into\n  Pappas'' lap.  Still standing
        next to the car.                           UTAH\n            Here''s your
        lemonade.\n                    (he looks down the\n                     street)\n            Did
        you see that T-Bird pull up?  Pappas pulls a disgusting mass from the bag,
        unwrapping\n  one end.                           PAPPAS\n                    (without
        looking)\n            Damn, I could eat the ass out of an\n            elephant.  I
        shoulda had you get me\n            three a these.  What T-Bird?  Pappas is
        about to take a huge bite when a meatball falls\n  out of the end of the sandwich.  It
        lands on the seat next\n  to him.\n  He looks at it.  Picks it up.  Pops it
        into his mouth\n  and--\n  Freezes, mouth open.  Eyes focused on...\n  The
        Ex-Presidents, in living color, flashing through the\n  doors of the bank
        80 feet away.  Johnny is so astounded he doesn''t do anything for about\n  two
        seconds.  Pappas coughs out his meatball, eyes\n  bugging.                           PAPPAS\n            Jesus
        Christ!!  It''s them!  The Presidents are piling into the car.\n  Johnny reacts
        characteristically.  He whips out the\n  Beretta and yells--                           UTAH\n            FBI!!  Freeze!!  Right
        now!  NIXON spins, raising his shotgun.\n  But Reagan knocks the muzzle down
        with his hand.  Shoves\n  him into the car.  Then Reagan jumps behind the
        wheel.\n  The back wheels light up, smoking, as the T-Bird launches.  Utah
        FIRES.\n  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!\n  He puts two into the trunk and blows the
        back window into\n  junk jewelry.  The T-Bird peels out into traffic, clipping\n  a
        Subaru which locks them up and spins.                           PAPPAS\n            Come
        on, kid, get in the car!\n            Jesus!\u003c\/p\u003e","created_at":"2015-07-03T08:26:03-04:00","handle":"trailblazer-the-book-12","id":1418685443,"product_type":"Bible","published_at":"2015-07-03T08:26:03-04:00","published_scope":"global","template_suffix":null,"title":"Trailblazer
