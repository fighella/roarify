        BUILDING - FBI BULLPEN<br>  Supervising Agent BEN HARP leads Utah across the
        bullpen.\n  Rows of desks.  Agents sitting at computer terminals.\n  Data
        hell.  Looks like he got a job at Xerox.<br>                           HARP\n            You
        know less than nothing.  If you\n            even knew that you knew nothing,
        at\n            least that would be something, but\n            you don''t.<br>                           UTAH\n            Yes,
        sir.<br>  Utah is wearing a suit, carrying a briefcase.  Harp is\n  mid-thirties,
        confident of stride, tanned of skin, perfect\n  of hair.  GQ.  Aggressive.<br>                           HARP\n            Eating
        solid breakfasts, Utah?<br>                           UTAH\n            Sir?<br>                           HARP\n            All
        the food groups?  Avoiding\n            sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that\n            my
        people maintain cardiovascular\n            fitness.  We stay off hard liquor,\n            cigarettes...<br>                           UTAH\n                    (poker
        face)\n            I take the skin off chicken.<br>  Harp glances at him,
        eyes narrowing.  They reach a\n  glassed-in compound of small offices.  Harp
        swings the\n  door open and the other agents look up as Utah enters.<br>                           HARP\n            This
        is us.  Bank Robbery.  And\n            you''re in the bank-robbery capital\n            of
        the world--<br>                           UTAH\n            1322 last year
        in LA county.  Up 26\n            percent from the year before.<br>                           HARP\n            That''s
        right.  And we nailed over a\n            thousand of them.  We did it by\n            crunching
        data.  Good crime-scene\n            work, good lab work, good data-base\n            analysis.  Nobody
        had to tackle a\n            car once.  You getting the signal,\n            special
        agent?<br>                           UTAH\n            Zero distortion, sir.<br>  He
        picks up a donut from someone''s desk, a succulent\n  glazed jelly.<br>                           UTAH\n            I
        love these things.<br>  He looks right at Harp.  Takes a big fuck-you bite.<br>                           HARP\n            You''re
        a real blue-flame special,\n            aren''t you, Utah?  I don''t know
        why\n            they sent you to LA.  Must be an\n            asshole shortage.<br>                           UTAH\n            Not

        blue field with a pulsing network of rippling lines.\n  VOOM!  A figure rockets
        down INTO FRAME in a curtain of\n  bubbles.  A gawky AGENT, in less than stylish
        FBI trunks,\n  flails around blindfolded looking for bricks at the bottom\n  of
        a pool.</p>","handle":"like-the-movie-20","product_type":"Video","published_at":"2015-07-10T08:43:03-04:00","published_scope":"global","tags":"","updated_at":"2015-07-10T08:43:03-04:00"}}'
