        gouges the face of a wave and\n  squirts out the other side.  Another wave
        rises and Utah\n  glides up over the hump.  He clears the swell and the\n  ocean
        suddenly smooths out like a giant lake.  Triumphant\n  over having made the

        the frustration, he turns his board around and starts\n  paddling hard.\n  He
        somehow gets the soles of his feet in contact with the\n  top of the board,
        then struggles up.  He''s standing --\n  sort of.\n  Arms pinwheeling, he
        topples in a nasty crash...\n  Right in front of a SHAVED-HEAD SURFER on full\n  afterburner.\u003cbr\u003e  Johnny

        for air, arms flailing.\n  His board, floating a few feet away, tugging at
        his ankle.\n  He drapes his torso across the board and pants for breath.\n  Razorhead,
        already back on his board, paddles over.\n  Points to a small dent in the
        fiberglass.\u003cbr\u003e                           RAZORHEAD\n            You

        CRUSHING RIGHT HOOK SMACKS HIS FACE!\n  Knocks him under.\n  Razorhead pulls
        a KNIFE from a sheath held by a thong\n  around his neck.  As Johnny surfaces,
        Razorhead slashes in\n  a vicious arc--\n  Severing Utah''s leash, close to
        the board.\n  His flame-job surfboard bobs away.\u003cbr\u003e                           RAZORHEAD\n            Politeness

        face-first\n  as the wave crashes over him.  Other surfers steer clear.\u003cbr\u003e  PAPPAS
        lounges in a beach chair in his plutonium pink\n  shorts, purple Vuarnet''s
        and a T-shirt emblazoned with\n  \"Surf This\" across the chest.  A picnic
        basket sits close\n  at hand.  He winces at Utah''s wipeout.  Shouts from
        his\n  beach chair.\u003cbr\u003e                           PAPPAS\n            I
        think you gotta hit them straight\n            on!\u003cbr\u003e                           UTAH\n                    (out
        of breath)\n            Got it...\u003cbr\u003e  UTAH holds the tip steady,
        gouges the face of a wave and\n  squirts out the other side.  Another wave
        rises and Utah\n  glides up over the hump.  He clears the swell and the\n  ocean
        suddenly smooths out like a giant lake.  Triumphant\n  over having made the
        lineup, he sits up on the board, and\n  falls over.\u003cbr\u003e  PAPPAS
        slices a green apple, some feta cheese and eats off\n  the knife.\u003cbr\u003e  UTAH
        climbs back on his board.  WHISTLES and HOOTS sound\n  as SURFERS spot a new
        swell.  Utah watches as the regulars\n  start catching rides.  Suddenly he
        feels like a lost dog\n  on a busy freeway.\n  A young LOCAL in a neon wetsuit
        slashes past him, inches\n  away.\u003cbr\u003e                           LOCAL\n            Outta
        the way, you dick!\u003cbr\u003e  Another, shredding viciously, is blasting
        toward him.\u003cbr\u003e                           LOCAL 2\n            Move
        it, kook!\u003cbr\u003e  Johnny paddles rapidly, ducks under.\n  Sees another,
        bigger wave coming.\n  Pissed off... at himself, at the downy-cheeked hotshots,\n  at
        the frustration, he turns his board around and starts\n  paddling hard.\n  He
        somehow gets the soles of his feet in contact with the\n  top of the board,
        then struggles up.  He''s standing --\n  sort of.\n  Arms pinwheeling, he
        topples in a nasty crash...\n  Right in front of a SHAVED-HEAD SURFER on full\n  afterburner.\u003cbr\u003e  Johnny
        vanishes in an explosion of spray.  His board\n  SHOOTS OUT.\n  It SMASHES
        SIDEWAYS INTO RAZORHEAD.\n  The guy does an ugly endo.\n  Utah comes up GASPING
        for air, arms flailing.\n  His board, floating a few feet away, tugging at
        his ankle.\n  He drapes his torso across the board and pants for breath.\n  Razorhead,
        already back on his board, paddles over.\n  Points to a small dent in the
        fiberglass.\u003cbr\u003e                           RAZORHEAD\n            You
        dinged my board, kook!!\u003cbr\u003e  Utah looks up in apology as--\n  A
        CRUSHING RIGHT HOOK SMACKS HIS FACE!\n  Knocks him under.\n  Razorhead pulls
        a KNIFE from a sheath held by a thong\n  around his neck.  As Johnny surfaces,
        Razorhead slashes in\n  a vicious arc--\n  Severing Utah''s leash, close to
        the board.\n  His flame-job surfboard bobs away.\u003cbr\u003e                           RAZORHEAD\n            Politeness
        counts, ASSHOLE!\u003cbr\u003e  The surf punk plunges under a wave, disappearing.\u003cbr\u003e                           UTAH\n            Goddamn
        son-of-a--\u003cbr\u003e  Before Utah can finish, another wave engulfs him
        and he\n  tumbles to shore, Razorhead nowhere to be seen.\u003cbr\u003e  ON
        PAPPAS as Johnny''s flame-job board washes in at his\n  feet.  He calmly picks
        it up as Utah staggers INTO FRAME\n  out of the knee-deep whitewash.  Johnny
        rubs his jaw.\n  Spits blood.\u003cbr\u003e                           PAPPAS\n            Kid,
        maybe this ain''t your sport.\u003cbr\u003e  Utah grabs the board out of Pappas''
        hands and stalks off\n  across the beach.\u003c\/p\u003e","created_at":"2015-07-18T06:56:56-04:00","handle":"i-was-like-the-movie-39","id":1674466819,"product_type":"Video","published_at":"2015-07-18T06:56:56-04:00","published_scope":"global","template_suffix":null,"title":"This
